# Katarzyna Heller
Hi! My name is Katarzyna. I am a Python backend developer. I spent last few years coding with Django and Django REST Framework. First building my own portfolio projects, but then joining development team. 

## Technology Stack: 
- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- AWS

## Previously: 
My journey in web development started with Wordpress. I spent projects like websites, online shops, e-course platforms with this CMS. 

## Fun fact: 
I was the only woman in a technical position at my last company, but I really enjoyed working with my male colleagues. However, I also support other women pursuing backend roles. I even gave a talk at the Her Story meetup during BBDays4IT on this topic.
